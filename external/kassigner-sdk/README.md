# KasSigner SDK — Rust/WASM

`kassigner-sdk` is the friendly, network-free facade a wallet integrates to support KasSigner hardware. It depends on `kassigner-protocol`; it is **not** a wallet implementation.

KasWare, Kaspium, and other wallets retain their existing UTXO discovery, automatic/manual coin selection, fees, outputs, change, privacy/consolidation policy, providers, and broadcast logic.

## Native Rust and stable errors

The default build is a genuinely native Rust SDK: WASM dependencies are target/feature-gated. Public operations return `SdkResult<T>` with a stable `SdkErrorKind` (for example `WrongNetwork`, `TransactionMismatch`, `PairingMismatch`, `PairingReplay`, `Qr`, and `Finalization`) so wallet code never needs to match error strings. Public extensible enums/types are `#[non_exhaustive]`; include a wildcard arm when matching them.

From a source checkout, keep the exact version and workspace path together:

```toml
[dependencies]
kassigner-sdk = { version = "=2.0.0", path = "../kassigner-sdk" }
```

After `2.0.0` is published to crates.io, an external consumer can use:

```toml
[dependencies]
kassigner-sdk = "=2.0.0"
```

```rust
use kassigner_sdk::{complete, finalize, prepare, Network};

// Host wallet constructs this PSKT using its own exact inputs and policy.
let request = prepare(&pskt_hex, Network::Mainnet)?;
for frame in request.qr_frames() {
    wallet_ui.render_qr(&frame.payload)?;
}

let signed = complete(&request, &scanned_response_hex)?;
let consensus_json = finalize(&signed)?;
wallet.broadcast(consensus_json)?;
```

There is intentionally no `prepareSend`, generic `createTransaction`, `sendTx`, or `broadcast` operation in the SDK.

`KasSigner` provides an instance-owned QR decoder plus descriptor/privacy pairing state. Successful privacy responses are bound to the pending nonce/ranges and stable account fingerprint, then consume the pending request.

## WebAssembly

WASM is an explicit build feature rather than an unconditional native dependency. The platform wrappers compile with `--no-default-features --features wasm`. Run `./build.sh` or `build.ps1`. The generated package is `@kassigner/sdk`; its JavaScript is generated `wasm-bindgen` glue around the Rust `.wasm`.

```js
import init, { KasSigner } from "@kassigner/sdk";

await init();
const signer = new KasSigner();
const request = JSON.parse(signer.prepare(psktHex, "mainnet"));
// Render each request.qrFrames[i].payload with your wallet's QR library.
const signed = JSON.parse(signer.complete(JSON.stringify(request), scannedResponseHex));
const consensusTx = signer.finalize(JSON.stringify(signed));
wallet.broadcast(consensusTx);
```

See `docs/integration/WALLET_INTEGRATION.md` for pairing, derivation metadata, publishing order, and conformance vectors.

## License

`kassigner-sdk`, `kassigner-protocol`, and their low-level `shared-signer` dependency are dual-licensed under **MIT OR Apache-2.0** so GPL, permissive, and proprietary wallets can integrate the hardware SDK without inheriting the application GPL. KasSigner/KasSee application code, firmware, `signer-firmware-core`, `offline-signer`, and `online-watcher` remain GPL-3.0.

## Signer capabilities

Wallets should call `kassigner_sdk::limits()` (or `KasSigner::limits()` in the WASM facade) before constructing requests. The returned `SignerCapabilities` describes the reference signer's current KSPT generation, 32-input transaction ceiling, output/script/redeem/payload bounds, multisig limits, and QR framing capacity. Treat these as hardware compatibility limits rather than wallet coin-selection policy; future signer generations may advertise different values.
